# Object Detection Using YOLO Tutorial

With this project, you'll obtain a Python code that can detect objects, providing their coordinates and class in a list format, similar to the example below:

```python
[    
    {"x": 100, "y": 200, "w": 100, "h": 50, "class": "Slime"},    
    {"x": 600, "y": 150, "w": 90, "h": 110, "class": "Orc"},    
    {"x": 350, "y": 400, "w": 180, "h": 20, "class": "Zombie"}
]
```


# Getting Started

To get started with this tutorial, follow these steps:
