# Object Detection Using YOLO Tutorial

With this project, you'll obtain a Python code that can detect objects, providing their coordinates and class in a list format, similar to the example below:

```python
[    
    {"x": 100, "y": 200, "w": 100, "h": 50, "class": "Slime"},    
    {"x": 600, "y": 150, "w": 90, "h": 110, "class": "Orc"},    
    {"x": 350, "y": 400, "w": 180, "h": 20, "class": "Zombie"}
]
```


# Getting Started

To get started with this tutorial, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Open a command line in the repository folder.

3. Install the required dependencies by running:

4. Execute the step-by-step instructions.


# Usage for ipynb file

1. For generating the dataset from application, in this case from the game.

2. Shuffling and Labeling dataset.

3. Training the dataset using Google Colab.
